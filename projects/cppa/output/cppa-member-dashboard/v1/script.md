## Voice Prompt

> Speak in a warm, clear, and reassuring tone. Pace yourself slowly and deliberately — your audience is older professionals who appreciate clarity over speed. Pause naturally between sentences. Think of a patient, friendly colleague walking someone through something on their computer for the first time. Never rush.

## Script

### 1. Segment 1

Welcome to the Conscious Physicians Psychedelic Academy. In this short walkthrough, I am going to show you how to use your member dashboard. We will look at your CEU credits, your sessions, and how to view and download your completion certificate. So let us get started.

### 2. Segment 2

To get to your dashboard, go to app dot cppa dot care in your web browser. You will see the sign-in page.

### 3. Segment 3

Click on the email field.

### 4. Segment 4

And type in the email address you registered with.

### 5. Segment 5

Now click on the password field.

### 6. Segment 6

Then click Sign In.

### 7. Segment 7

And here we are. This is your member dashboard. It is your home base for everything related to your continuing education.

### 8. Segment 8

At the top, you will notice three summary cards. Let me walk you through each one.

### 9. Segment 9

This first card shows your Total CEU Credits. This is the total number of continuing education credits you have earned across all of your completed sessions.

### 10. Segment 10

The second card shows Sessions Attended. This is simply how many sessions you have completed so far.

### 11. Segment 11

And the third card shows your Upcoming Sessions, so you always know what is coming up next on your schedule.

### 12. Segment 12

Below those cards, you will see a section called Next Session. This gives you the details for your next upcoming session, including the date, time, and who will be presenting.

### 13. Segment 13

Now, if you scroll down a little further, you will find your CEU Summary. This is a complete record of every session you have completed.

### 14. Segment 14

Each row shows you the date of the session, the session title, and the number of CEU credits you received. It is all right here in one place.

### 15. Segment 15

Now. Here is the part I think you are really going to enjoy.

### 16. Segment 16

You see that button that says View Certificate? Go ahead and click on it.

### 17. Segment 17

There it is. Your official CEU Completion Certificate.

### 18. Segment 18

It has your name, the session you completed, the date, and the credits you earned. This is your proof of professional development, and it is yours to keep.

### 19. Segment 19

To save a copy, just click this Download button right here. It will save as a PDF file to your computer. You can print it, email it, or keep it for your records.

### 20. Segment 20

And that is everything. Your dashboard keeps all of your credits, sessions, and certificates in one place. If you ever have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to help. Thank you for being a part of the Conscious Physicians Psychedelic Academy.
